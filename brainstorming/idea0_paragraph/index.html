    <p>Hey, it's <span class="name">Jaclyn Paul</span>. You know, the quiet girl in front of you in study hall senior year who was always <a href="#">writing</a> stories.
    You probably haven't thought <a href="#">about me</a> in a long time, but I'll never forget you.
    I would pretend I didn't notice you looking over my shoulder, but my heart raced every time.
    Anyway, I have this <a href="#">blog</a> now, and I wanted to tell you about it because I want
    to know that you might be reading my stories again.</p>

    <p>-jp</p>

    <p>p.s. I'm sorry I never said hi.</p>
